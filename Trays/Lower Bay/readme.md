# Trays/Lower Bay

## Overview

Lower bay trays mount miscellaneous hardware, e.g.:

- Buck converters
- MOSFETS
- Solid state relays (SSRs)
- 40mm fans

These trays also come in two sizes, half-length and full-length. More information is available in the [lower bay documentation][1].

## Requirements

Folders often contain multiple variants. Each folder has a readme that discusses fastener and component requirements for each variant.

## Template Files

A blank template in both STEP and Fusion formats is available in the `Template` subfolder.
