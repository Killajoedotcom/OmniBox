:material-alpha-t-box: :material-alpha-l-box-outline: Lower Bay Trays mount below the MCU board and are used for a wide range of parts. Parts compatible with the lower bay are listed here. The [Trays\Lower Bay][5] git folder is organized with subfolders for each supported part. All variations based around that part are in the same folder.

There are two types of :material-alpha-t-box: :material-alpha-l-box-outline: Lower Bay Trays: half and full. A full length tray covers the mount points of two half trays and must be mounted from front to back of the case.
