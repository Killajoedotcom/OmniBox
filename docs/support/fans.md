This is a list of all fans that are supported by OmniBox.

An assortment of :material-alpha-f-box: :material-alpha-c-box-outline: fan cages and :material-alpha-f-box: :material-alpha-g-box-outline: fan gaskets are available in the [Fan Cages][6] git folder for all listed fans.

OmniBox also has optional, concealed mounts for 40x40x10mm fans. These are compatible with gaskets but do not use fan cages.
