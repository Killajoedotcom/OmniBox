## The Process

| Development Photos |   |
|--------------------|---|
| My only working Steve Burcham case. It has an SKR 1.4 inside (instead of an SKR 2), which is probably why it's still working. | [![the original](img/gallery_0.9/the_original_v5.jpg)] |
| The initial main body prototype, looking awkward. | [![original prototype](img/gallery/prototype.jpg)](img/gallery/prototype.jpg) |
| Size comparison: Left is an example of Steve's V5 case (with custom panels). On the right is one of the first OmniBoxes during assembly. | [![size comparison](img/gallery/size_comparison.jpg)](img/gallery/size_comparison.jpg) |
| The first and second finished case bodies, waiting for more panels to finish printing. | [![one and two](img/gallery/one_and_two.jpg)](img/gallery/one_and_two.jpg) |
| Testing for fit with all of the connectors in place. | [![finished rear panel](img/gallery/finished_rear.jpg)](img/gallery/finished_rear.jpg) |
