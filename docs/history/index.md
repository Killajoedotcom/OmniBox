<!-- ### Core Improvements -->

## Panels and Trays

- Lids for spools!
    - An adaptation of my [Tighter T.U.S.H. spool holder][2] (a remix of the original T.U.S.H.).
    - It mounts on a lid that integrates the spool holder guide.
    - The guide makes the spool holder adjustable to spool width (up to about 120mm).
- Lids for dryboxes!
    - A lid for [Rubbermaid 21 cup containers][1].
    - These containers are about $5 each at Ace Mart.
    - There are often clones of these on Amazon that are slightly more expensive (about $8-10 ea).
    - May have lids for generic containers in the near future as a user contribution.

### Experimental Hardware Support

These parts are still experimental from the prior release.

| Hardware | Mount Location(s) | Notes |
|----------|-------------------|-------|
| Mean Well RSP-500 power supply | Main body | For the Ender 5 Plus |
| Raspberry Pi TFTs | Display mount or half-lid | |
| Fotek SSR-60 DA solid state relay | Lower bay | |
| 92mm fans | Rear panel, lid | 25mm thickness; no compatible mount yet. |

## Documentation & Repository

- Documentation site has a modified color scheme and fonts for readability.
- New dark theme for the doc site.

## Known Issues

- The front main body with a 40mm intake fan partially obscures a mounting hole for the base to the main body. This leave seven (7) other mount points and is not a significant issue. The hole can safely be left empty.
