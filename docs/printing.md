This page has commonly used settings for printing OmniBox and a printed part checklist. See the [guided tour](tour.md) for help choosing the correct parts.

## Print Settings

These settings are consistent for all parts.

| Setting            | Value       | Note |
|--------------------|-------------|------|
| Layer Height       | 0.2-0.24mm  | Adaptive layer heights can be used. Coarser settings have not been tested. |
| Perimeters (Walls) | 3           | Walls should be at least 1.2mm thick. |
| Infill             | 20-25%      | Cubic is a good tradeoff of time and durability. |
| Material           | PLA or PLA+ | PETG is somewhat brittle and may take longer to print on many printers. |
| Nozzle Diameter    | 0.4mm       | 0.6mm should also work. If you print a case with a different nozzle size, please share your results! |
