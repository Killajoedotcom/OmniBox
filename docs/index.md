## About OmniBox

OmniBox is 3D printable, modular electronics case for 3D printers. OmniBox comes with support for a wide variety of parts and includes templates to add support for new ones. 

This project is derived from Steve Burcham's [Stand Alone Main Control Case][10] V3 footprint.

## Version Stability Guarantee

Printing OmniBox is a time investment. This makes incompatibility between versions painful; upgrading one printed part should not require others to be reprinted. Thankfully, OmniBox is highly modular and can be upgrade piecemeal.

I've extended that modularity with a "Version Stability Guarantee":

The printed components of OmniBox are "stable" or "frozen" in how they connect with other printed parts. This means that if you choose to print a newer version of a core part, no panels or trays will need to be reprinted.

See the [Visual Guided Tour][11] to see how this works in practice.

## Current Status

OmniBox is currently pre-1.0 but mature enough for everyday use.

See the [Version History][4] page for information on the latest release, fixes, new features, and known issues.
