All of the panels are customizable, so this section has a less formal Parts section. 

## 1. Front Panel

You will need:

- 2x M3 x 8mm screws
- Your printed front panel
- Any accessories that mount to it and fasteners for them

| Step | Example |
|------|---------|
| If you have any add-ons for your front panel (such as a MicroSD extension) install these first. | [![panel with installed extensions][9]][9] |
| Push the panel into place. | [![placing the front vent][1]][1] |
| Fasten the panel with two (2) M3 screws. | [![front vent installed][2]][2] |

## 2. Rear Panel

You will need:

- 8x M4 x 8mm screws
- Your printed rear panel
- Any connectors or other accessories for the rear panel

| Step | Example |
|------|---------|
| If you are using the rear panel to mount connectors, it is strongly advised that you insert the connectors before installing the panel or connecting any wires to the board. | |
| Push the rear panel in place. You may need to guide the wires out of the way. | [![first two screws][5]][5] |
| Attach the panel using eight (8) M4 screws. | [![panel with screws inserted][6]][6] | 


It's a good idea to attach your wiring now, before we close up the case further.

## 3. Display Screen

You will need:

- 4x M3 x 6mm screws
- 4x M4 x 12mm screws
- Your printed display mount
- Your display

!!! note
    Some display mounts have more than one piece and require additional screws. The below is an example with a stock Creality 12864 display.

| Step | Example |
|------|---------|
| Remove the knob on the display screen. It should pull off. | [![removing the display knob][10]][10] |
| Slide the screen into place on the mount and fasten with four (4) M3 x 6mm screws. | [![attach the screen][3]][3] |
| Re-attach the knob to the display screen. Again, it should slide into place with light force. If your display mount has multiple pieces, attach those now (usually only applies to displays with side-mount SD card readers). | |
| Insert the display connectors and slide the cables in before the display. Fasten the display panel with four (4) M4 x 12mm screws. | [![screws attached][4]][4] |


## 4. Lid

Like the rear panel, the lid is intended for customization. The below is an example for a simple lid with a handle.

!!! note
    0.9.8 introduces half-length lids. One half-length lid requires four (4) screws; a full length lid attaches with eight (8) The main body requires two (2) half-length lids or one full-length lid.

You will need:

- 10x M3 x 8mm screws (2x for handle, 8x for lid)
- Printed [carry handle][12]
- Printed [carry handle lid][13]

| Step | Example |
|------|---------|
| Attach the handle to the lid first. | [![attaching the handle][11]][11] |
| Use the eight (8) M3 screws to attach the lid, Any length up to 16mm will work. | [![first two screws][8]][8] | 

!!! note
    Because the screws are threaded directly into plastic, removing and reattaching the lid will eventually wear out the holes in the main body. I recommend starting with shorter screws and gradually switching to longer ones over time to get "fresh" plastic.
