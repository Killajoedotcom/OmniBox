Assuming that you have all of the parts pre-printed and have never assembled an OmniBox, it takes about one hour for assembly. This does not include the time needed to run and attach wiring.

!!! note
    These instructions are for the default OmniBox fan configuration (two 40mm fans for the rear main body and no front body fan). They cover aspects of mounting fan cages common for all OmniBox fan mounts. The size and location of fans in your configuration may vary.

    This guide cannot cover every mounting combination for trays and panels; however, the git repository should have BOM information for mounting components to their respective tray or panel.

    Areas where the Core parts may differ from instructions are specifically called out.

This guide is divided into three sections:

- [Core](core.md): Assembly of the main body and base; power supply mounting
- [Trays](trays.md): Lower bay, CPU, and MCU tray assembly
- [Panels](panels.md): Displays, lids, front & rear panels

Photos from this assembly process are from the 0.9.8 release. If you have an older or newer version, some configuration details may differ.
