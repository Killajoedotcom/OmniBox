This is an overview of components supported by OmniBox. The linked git folders should contain both an `STL` for printing and a `STEP` to allow modification. Fusion files are also typically available where they can be exported.

## Trays

### CPU and MCU Trays

See [CPU and MCU Boards][2] for a list of boards with existing trays.

### Lower Bay Trays

OmniBox has a lower bay for mounting parts such as buck converters and solid state elays (SSRs). Some trays mount multiple parts or an added 40mm fan.

See [Lower Bay Components][4] for a complete list of parts with trays available.

## Display Screen Panels

[Display Panels][3] are used for LCD displays. Note that these are not the same as Raspberry Pi screens.

## Front and Rear Panels

These panels are typically used for mounting [fans](fans.md) and [panel mounted connectors](panel_mounts.md).

Generic rear panels are available with cutouts to pass wiring directly without using connectors.
