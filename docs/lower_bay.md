Some components can only be mounted on lower bay trays. Parts compatible with the lower bay are listed here. The files for the tray variations are stored in the [Trays\Lower Bay][5] git folder.

Additionally, trays come in two lengths: small and large. A large tray covers the mount points of two small trays and must be mounted from front to back of the case.
