Welcome to the OmniBox repository. This is a modular control case for 3D printing. It is conceptually derived from Steve Burcham's [Stand Alone Main Control Case](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3999751), but is incompatible except with respect to display screens.

Head to the [documentation](https://jon-harper.github.io/OmniBox) for more information.
