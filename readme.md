## Caution

You are in the `0.9.9-beta` branch. Changes may be merged in at any time, but all parts have been tested for fit. Documentation for *this* branch specifically is located at [https://jon-harper.github.io/OmniBox-docs/](https://jon-harper.github.io/OmniBox-docs/).

If you are looking for a part that is not listed, it may be untested but available in the `0.9.9-unstable` branch.

-----

Welcome to the OmniBox repository! OmniBox is a modular, 3D printed electronics case for controlling 3D printers. It is conceptually derived from Steve Burcham's [Stand Alone Main Control Case](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3999751) V3.

This project focuses on modularity, accessibility to users, and reusability. The goal of OmniBox is to make your printer's electronics as valuable and re-usable an asset as the printer it controls.
