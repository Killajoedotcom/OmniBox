Welcome to the OmniBox repository. This is a modular control case for 3D printing. It is conceptually derived from Steve Burcham's [Stand Alone Main Control Case](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3999751) V3. It is a new design but maintains compatibility with existing display panels.

Head to the **[documentation](https://jon-harper.github.io/OmniBox)** for more information, including a Bill of Materials, list of supported parts, and guides for both printing and assembly.
