This project is derived from the Steve Burcham's Stand Alone Main Control Case V3 footprint; it is a unique design with a lower height and compatibility with larger microcontroller unit (MCU) boards like BIGTREETECH's Octopus. Smaller boards will also fit and the case is compatible with a wide range of parts. Front Left Render Right Side View Quick Links GitHub with STLs Visual Guided Tour Supported Part List Printing Guide Bill of Materials Assembly Guide Version Stability Guarantee OmniBox takes some time to print in its entirety. This makes incompatibility between versions painful; upgrading one printed part should not require others to be reprinted. The printed components of OmniBox are \"stable\" or \"frozen\" in how they connect with other printed parts. This means that if you choose to print a newer version of a Core part, no panels or trays will need to be reprinted. With version 0.9.8: The mounting interfaces for panels and trays are frozen. Old panels and trays will always be usable with new Core components and vice versa. In addition, the interface between Core components is frozen across all versions, e.g., a base can be used with a main body of a different version. About / Background The Requirements Enclosed 3D printing requires controlling more hardware than comes with a typical 3D printer: Lighting Webcam Thermistor for air termperature Filtration and exhaust fans My enclosures are safe to 60C, but I don't want to expose my electronic hardware to that. I printed my first of Steve's electronics cases to remove my hardware from the heat. Most common devices like fans and lights (and Raspberry Pis!) need a buck converter to work with a 3D printer's power supply. My printed cases for these printer/enclosure combos became cramped. Each buck converter had to sit on a tray above the microcontroller unit (MCU); wiring changes to the MCU required that I first remove up to three buck converter trays. Additionally, I wanted to use the BIGTREETECH's Octopus in a case, which I had used to success with another project. The Octopus 1.1 is a solid board that provides ample power sources and signal pins. The Octopus does not fit the cases I had already printed; I also had several ideas to improve upon Steve's case. With these requirements and goals in mind, I decided to design my own case. Building the OmniBox This is my second electronics case for the Octopus designed around general shape and layout from Steve's V3 case. I kept full compatibility only with the original display screens. Lids should be easy to modify to fit. Templates are provided for all trays and panels to allow further customization and support for new products. Other Improvements These are other changes and improvements present in OmniBox: Buck converters, solid state relays (SSRs), and other additional hardware can be mounted below the board instead of above. The rear panel is larger and covers most of the base. The base is approximately 1.2\" shorter; wires are meant to exit from the back or top of the electronics case. The case is designed to draw air upwards and out past the MCU drivers, providing effective cooling with two 40mm fans. Some screws that were M4 are now M3.","title":"About OmniBox"},{"location":"#quick-links","text":"GitHub with STLs Visual Guided Tour Supported Part List Printing Guide Bill of Materials Assembly Guide","title":"Quick Links"},{"location":"#version-stability-guarantee","text":"OmniBox takes some time to print in its entirety.

Use the four (4) M4 screws to fasten them together. Note: Make sure the sawtooth air vents on both halves are facing the same direction, as in the picture. Push the power switch into the cutout in the front of the base. The sides of the switch will compress until it snaps into place. Insert the IEC socket into the rear base, followed by the M3 x 16mm screws. There are two pockets for hex nuts opposing the M3 screws. One hex nut at a time, press a nut in place while turning the opposing screw. Once the threads of the screw catch the nut, continue threading until the nut is tight. There is a 40mm fan mount behind one of the front air vents. If you wish to use a 40mm fan there, install it now with four (4) M3 x 16mm machine screws. Now is a good time to run the AC wiring for the power supply. Zip tie anchors are available for the wire run from socket to switch and back to power supply.

Printed crossbar 1 Main Body - Crossbar A power supply unit (PSU) 1 Notes and Cautions: Note Sharp point screws are easier to use than machine scews for attaching the main body and base. For this you can use #6 x 3/4\" screws (SAE) or M3 x 20mm (metric) screws found at any hardware store. If these are not convenient or available, machine screws will work in their place. Caution Always stop if you feel resistance when fastening screws to the power supply. Screws longer than 8mm may touch components in the power supply and short or damage them. Most models have no extra cleareance for overtightening if 8mm machine screws are used; thus we advice 6mm for safety. Directions: Step Example Using six (6) M3 x 8mm screws, add a screw at a time to fasten the rear body to the front. Alternate sides with each screw. Note : Insert the screws from the back to the front of the case. Here we have all six screws inserted. Line up the holes on the top of the power supply with the main body. The holes pointed at in the picture need to align. Mount the power supply using four (4) M4 x 8mm screws. Place the assembled main body on top of the base. Using your long machine or sheet metal screws, partially thread one screw near one of the rear corners and an opposing front corner. Fasten the main body and base together with your long M3 or #6 screws. Place the crossbar in place at the joint between the lid and display mounts. Take note of the orientation in the picture. Attach the crossbar with an M3 x 16mm screw in each side. 3. Fans Fan locations and sizes vary by configuration. This section is specific to the configuration assembled in this guide. The length of screws needed and printed parts will vary, but the method of mounting fans used here is identical for all sizes of externally mounted fans.

The stickered side of the motor indicates direction of airflow, so we have it facing towards the fan grill. (Optional) If you are using TPU gaskets, place a gasket over the fan and cage. Carefully cut out a small space for the wire to pass through. Insert the fan's wires through the cutout in the main body. Partially thread in two (2) M3 x 20mm screws on opposing sides of the fan cage. Insert and thread the other two (2) M3 screws. Ensure the fan's wires do not pinch or bind, then finish tightening all four (4) screws. Repeat the above process for the second fan.

Fans"},{"location":"assembly/panels/","text":"All of the panels are customizable, so this section has a less formal Parts section. Each starts with a list of the basics required to attach any type of that panel mount. Any additional parts needed for the panel we are using as an example are listed separately. 1. Front Panel You will need at least: Parts Qty Note Printed front panel 1 M3 x 8mm machine screws 2 All front panels mount using two (2) of these. In this example, we will use: Parts Qty Note Front Panel - Micro SD Extension with USB C.stl 1 Printed front panel example Micro SD card extension 1 USB C panel mount extension 1 M3 x 6mm machine screws 2 M3 x 8mm machine screws 2 Step Example The USB C panel mount comes with screws and attaches directly. Carefully remove the outer shell from the Micro SD card extension. Place the reader PCB into the shell, as in the picture. Put the shell lid on and attach with two (2) M3 x 6mm screws. Insert the extension shell into the front panel and attach with two (2) M3 x 8mm screws. Push the panel into place on the main body. Fasten the panel with two (2) M3 x 8mm screws. 2a. Rear Panel You will need at least: Parts Qty Note A printed rear panel 1 M4 x 8mm machine screws 8 All rear panels mount using eight (8) of these. Our rear panel in this example is a panel mount test piece, but all rear panels follow the same pattern. Some rear panels may have a fan to mount. If you are using the rear panel to mount connectors, it is strongly advised that you insert the connectors before installing the panel or connecting any wires to the board. Step Example Push the rear panel in place against the back of the case. You may need to guide the wires out of the way. Attach the panel using eight (8) M4 screws. 2b. Rear Panel Wiring It's a good idea to attach your wiring to the MCU now, before we close up the case further. 3. Display Screen You will need at least: Parts Qty Note Printed display panel 1 LCD display 1 M4 x 12mm machine screws 4 All display screen panels mount using four (4) of these. For this example, we will use: Parts Qty Note Generic 12864 Display Mount 1 Example of a printed display panel. Creality 12864 display 1 LCD display example M3 x 6mm machine screws 4 Note Some display mounts have more than one piece and require additional screws. The below is an example with a stock Creality 12864 display. Step Example Remove the knob on the display screen. It should pull off. Slide the screen into place on the mount and fasten with four (4) M3 x 6mm screws. Re-attach the knob to the display screen. Again, it should slide into place with light force. If your display mount has multiple pieces, attach those now (usually only applies to displays with side-mount SD card readers). Insert the display connectors and slide the cables in before the display. Fasten the display panel with four (4) M4 x 12mm screws. 4. Lid Like the rear panel, the lid is intended for customization. The below is an example for a simple lid with a handle. You will need for any lid or pair of half-lids: Parts Qty Note M3 x 8mm machine screws 8 See note below. Printed lid 1 In this example, we also use: Parts Qty Note M3 x 8mm machine screws 2 Carry handle 1 Carry handle lid 1 Example of a printed lid. Note 0.9.8 introduces half-length lids. One half-length lid requires four (4) screws; a full length lid attaches with eight (8) The main body requires two (2) half-length lids or one (1) full-length lid. Note Because the screws are threaded directly into plastic, removing and reattaching the lid will eventually wear out the holes in the main body. I recommend starting with shorter (8mm) screws and gradually switching to longer ones over time to get \"fresh\" plastic. Lids may use screws up to 16mm in length.

The linked git folders should contain both an STL for printing and a STEP to allow modification. Fusion files are also typically available where they can be exported. Power Supplies OmniBox supports the Mean Well LRS-350 and clones (e.g., Landy). There is preliminary support for the Mean Well RSP-500. The main body comes in different versions for power supply compatibility. Each power supply has a git folder under Core , e.g Core/Mean Well LRS-350 . After you choose a front and rear main body version , print the STLs from the folder that matches your power supply. Power Supply Note Mean Well LRS-350 Most Creality Ender-series printers use the LRS-350-24. Mean Well RSP-500 (Preliminary) RSP-500-24 is used in the Ender 5 Plus. Trays CPU and MCU Trays See CPU and MCU Boards for a list of boards with existing trays. Lower Bay Trays OmniBox has a lower bay for mounting parts such as buck converters and solid state elays (SSRs). Some trays mount multiple parts or an added 40mm fan. See Lower Bay Components for a complete list of parts with trays available. Display Screen Panels Display Panels are used for LCD displays. Note that these are not the same as Raspberry Pi screens. Front and Rear Panels These panels are typically used for panel mounted connectors and extensions . Generic rear panels are available with cutouts to pass wiring directly without using connectors. Fans An assortment of fans are supported and include cages and optional TPU shims. See the Fans page for a full list. The front and rear main bodies come in versions with and without fans. The rear panel and lid can also be used for mounting fans.
