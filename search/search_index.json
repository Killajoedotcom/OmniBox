This project is conceptually derived from Steve Burcham's Stand Alone Main Control Case , but is incompatible except with respect to display screens. Background I had a catastrophic failure of multiple BIGTREETECH SKR 2 boards in a row. I print a lot of ABS, which means controlling an enclosure with lights, fans, etc.--and that equates to a lot of buck converters. BIGTREETECH's Octopus 1.1 is a solid board that provides ample power sources and signal pins. It also (so far) hasn't blown out any of my equipment or itself. Unfortunately, the existing control cases I had printed didn't fit the Octopus; I also had a few ideas for changes and improvements. This is my second control case for the Octopus centered around the footprint used by Steve's V3 case. Since the source is not availabe for the base or main body, I redesigned the case from scratch, keeping compatibility only with the original display screens. Lids should be easy to modify to fit, as they maintain the same overall dimensions.

Use the four (4) M4 screws to fasten them togther. Note: The sawtooth air vents should be aligned the same way on the front and back. Insert the power switch into the front. The sides should compress until it snap in place. Main Body You will need: 6x M3 x 8-12mm screws (8, 10, or 12mm will work) 8x M3 x 12-20mm screws or 8x M3/#6 sharp point screws (12mm-20mm or 1/2\" to 3/4\") 2x M3 x 16mm screws 4x M4 x 8mm screws The printed front and rear main body The printed front crossbar Your power supply unit (PSU) Step Example Assemble the front and rear using six (6) M3 screws. Any length between 8mm and 12mm will work. Make sure you insert the screws fron the back side into the front of the case. Here we have all six screws inserted. The fans in the photos were added early; we will do those shortly. The power supply fits under the main body and is slightly offset towards the front right. Line up the holes on the top of the power supply with the main body. Mount the power supply using 4x M4 x 8mm screws. Place the assembled main body on top of the base. There are eight (8) ~3mm holes that should line up between the base and main body, four on each side. Fasten the main body and base together with your long M3 screws or sheet metal screws. Place the crossbar in place at the joint between the lid and display mounts. Take note of the orientation in the picture. Using the two (2) M3 x 16mm screws, attach the crossbar with a screw in each side. Dual 40mm Exhaust Fans You will need: 8x M3 x 12mm screws (10mm will also work) 2x 40x40x10mm fans Two printed 40mm Fan Cages Step Example Place a fan inside the cage with the stickered side of the motor facing away from the fan cage grill. Insert two M3 screws on opposing sides of the fan cage and through the fan's mounting holes. Thread the fan's wires through the fan cutout, then line up the fan and cage with the mounting holes. Partially tighten both screws until at least two full turns of thread are holding the fan in place. Insert and tighten the other two M3 screws. Finish tightening the screws until all four screws are firmly in place. Ensure the fan wire feeds through the cutout without pinching or binding, then repeat the above process for the second fan. CPU Tray You will need: 2-4 M3 x 6mm screws 2-4 M3 x 8mm screws A Raspberry Pi 3B+ or 4B The printed CPU tray for your Raspberry Pi Step Example The Raspberry Pi comes with M2.5 screw holes, but can be bored out easily with M3 screws. Mount your Raspberry Pi with 6mm M3 screws onto the tray, using at least two screws. Slide the tray into the side bay on the left side. 3. Use at least two (2) M3 x 8mm screws to fasten the tray in place. MCU Tray You will need: 2x M4 x 8mm screws 2-4 M3 x 6mm screws Your MCU (e.g. BTT Octopus) The printed tray for your MCU Step Example Attach your MCU with at least two M3 x 6mm screws to the tray. The screw holes face forward when inserted to the case; prefer to align your SD card connector to the front and power connectors to the back. Your likely limitation is the length of the SD card extension connector, if you plan to use one. Slide the tray from the back of the assembled case to the front. Stop when the two screw holes on the sides align. Tighten the tray in place with two (2) M4 x 8mm screws. Now is a good time to attach the wires for your power supply, as well. Front Panel You will need: 2x M3 x 8mm screws Your printed front panel Any accessories that mount to it and fasteners Step Example If you have any add-ons for your front panel, like an MicroSD extension, install these first. Insert the front panel and attach with two (2) M3 screws. Rear Panel You will need: 4-8 M4 x 8mm screws Your printed rear panel Any connectors or other accessories for the rear panel Step Example If you are using the rear panel to mount connectors, it is strongly advised that you insert the connectors to the panel first, before installing the panel or connecting any wires to the board. Line up the rear panel with the cutout on the assembled case. It may pinch near the base--this is due to the walls leaning outwards further up as they cool. The rear panel will help keep the walls aligned. Check where the screw holes line up. If any are clearly unaligned, leave those for last. Starting with a screw hole near the top, partially thread an M4 screw in. Stop once you can feel the screw threads grab the main body at least two full turns. Find another screw hole near the top on the opposite side and partially thread it in two full turns. Fill in a screw hole on each side on the bottom half, at a minimum. Continue to insert screws into the remaining holes. If any of the holes are still unaligned, you can leave them empty or insert a screw at an angle and thread. It may work itself straight. Finish tightening all of the screws. Now that the power switch, power connector, and PSU are all installed, it's a good time to wire them up. Display Screen You will need: 4 M4 x 8mm screws 4 M3 x 6mm screws Your printed display mount Your display If your display mount contains more than one piece, screws to join them. Step Example Remove the knob on the display screen. It should pull off. Slide the screen into place on the mount and fasten with four (4) M3 x 6mm screws. Re-attach the knob to the display screen. Again, it should slide into place with light force. If your display mount has multiple pieces, attach those now (usually only applies to displays with side-mount SD cards). Attach the display connectors and slide the ends in first. Attach the display panel with two (2) M4 x 8mm screws on opposings sides. Avoid overtightening. The angle of the display may require inserting the remaining two (2) screws at an angle. You may also need to back out the first screws slightly and angle them as well. This is an artifact of the display angle. Lid Step Example The lid is highly customizable. Here we're using a simple lid with a handle. All of the lids attach with between four (4) and eight (8) M3 x 8mm screws, although any length up to 16mm will work. Note Since the lid is most frequently removed, the plastic threads will wear out with time. I recommend starting with a short thread and lengthening the screws over time to get \"fresh\" plastic.","title":"Assembly Guide"},{"location":"assembly/#base","text":"You will need: 4x M4 x 16mm screws (20mm is also acceptable) 1x SPST toggle switch The printed front and rear base Step Example The two pieces of the base both have two (2) M4 screw holes on each side.
