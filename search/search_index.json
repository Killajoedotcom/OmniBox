This project is conceptually derived from Steve Burcham's Stand Alone Main Control Case V3 footprint; it is a unique design with a lower height and compatibility with larger microcontroller unit (MCU) boards like BIGTREETECH's Octopus. Smaller boards will also fit. Quick Links GitHub with STLs Supported Part List Bill of Materials Printing Guide Assembly Guide About / Background The Requirements Printing Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) plastic requires the use of an enclosure with filtration. This typically requires connecting additional hardware to a printer's MCU: Interior lighting Ambient temperature thermistor Filtration and exhaust fans As 24V is the common DC voltage for 3D printers right now, each 12V independantly-controllable or PWM device such as a fan or light strip needs a buck converter. My control cases for these printer/enclosure combos were cramped\u2014the three or more buck converters mounted over the MCU kept me from accessing the wiring underneath. Additionally, after multiple Dead-On-Arrival (DOA) and failed BIGTREETECH SKR 2 boards, I urgently had to find another board to settle on. Enter the Octopus, which I had used to success with another project. Switching to the Octopus BIGTREETECH's Octopus 1.1 is a solid board that provides ample power sources and signal pins. This includes six PWM pins with a jumper to change the voltage level from 24V to 12V or 5V, eliminating my need for buck converters. It also (so far) hasn't blown out any of my equipment or itself and is similarly priced to the SKR 2. The Octopus will not fit the existing control cases I had already printed; I also had a several improvements in mind for Steve's case concept. Building the OmniBox This is my second control case for the Octopus designed around general shape and layout from Steve's V3 case. I kept full compatibility only with the original display screens. Lids should be easy to modify to fit, as they maintain the same overall dimensions (note that the screw holes are M3 now, however). Templates are provided for all trays and panels to allow further customization and support for new products. Other Improvements These are other changes and improvements present in OmniBox: Buck converters, solid state relays (SSRs), and other additional hardware can be mounted below the board instead of above. The rear panel is larger and covers most of the base. The base is approximately 1.2\" shorter; wires are meant to exit from the back or top of the control case. The case is designed to draw air upwards and out past the MCU drivers, providing effective cooling with two 40mm fans. Some screws that were M4 are now M3.","title":"About"},{"location":"#quick-links","text":"GitHub with STLs Supported Part List Bill of Materials Printing Guide Assembly Guide","title":"Quick Links"},{"location":"#about-background","text":"","title":"About / Background"},{"location":"#the-requirements","text":"Printing Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) plastic requires the use of an enclosure with filtration.

This does not include the time needed to run and attach wiring. Note These instructions are for the default OmniBox configuration (two 40mm fans for the rear main body and no front body fan). They cover aspects common to all OmniBox printers and demonstrate mounting fan cages. The size and location of fans in your configuration may vary. 1. Base You will need: 4x M4 x 16mm screws (20mm will work) 1x SPST toggle switch The printed front and rear base Step Example The two pieces of the base both have two (2) holes on each side. Use the four (4) M4 screws to fasten them together. Note: Make sure the sawtooth air vents on both halves are facing the same direction, as in the picture. Push the power switch into the cutout in the front of the base. The sides of the switch will compress until it snaps into place. 2. Main Body You will need: 6x M3 x 8 screws (8-12mm will work) 8x #6 x 3/4\" screws (see note below) 2x M3 x 16mm screws 4x M4 x 6mm screws (see caution below) The printed front and rear main body The printed front crossbar Your power supply unit (PSU) Note The main body and base with can be attached more easily with sharp point wood screws than machine screws. For this you can use #6 x 3/4\" screws (SAE) or M3 x 20mm (metric) screws found at any hardware store. If these are not convenient or available, machine screws will work in their place. Caution Do not use screws longer than 6mm to attach the power supply. Longer screws may touch components in the power supply and short or damage them. Step Example Assemble the front and rear using six (6) M3 x 8mm screws. Note : Insert the screws from the back to the front of the case. Here we have all six screws inserted. The fans in the photos were added early; we will do those shortly. Line up the holes on the top of the power supply with the main body. The power supply sit underneath is slightly offset towards the front right. Mount the power supply using four (4) M4 x 8mm screws. Place the assembled main body on top of the base. There are eight (8) holes near the outside walls. Fasten the main body and base together with your long M3 screws or sheet metal screws. Place the crossbar in place at the joint between the lid and display mounts. Take note of the orientation in the picture. Attach the crossbar with an M3 x 16mm screw in each side. 3. Dual 40mm Exhaust Fans You will need: 8x M3 x 12mm screws (up to 16mm will also work) 2x 40x40x10mm fans 2x printed 40mm fan cages Step Example Place a fan inside the cage with the stickered side of the motor facing towards the fan grill. Insert two M3 screws on opposite sides of the fan cage and through the fan's mounting holes. Thread the fan's wires through the fan cutout in the main body, then line up the fan and cage with the mounting holes. Partially tighten both screws until at least two full turns of thread are holding the fan in place. Insert and tighten the other two M3 screws. Finish tightening the screws until all four screws are firmly in place. Ensure the fan wire feeds through the cutout without pinching or binding. Repeat the above process for the second fan. 4. CPU Tray You will need: 4 M3 x 6mm screws 4 M3 x 8mm screws A Raspberry Pi 3B+ or 4B (or other SoC CPU) A printed CPU tray matching your SoC CPU Note The Raspberry Pi comes with M2.5 screw holes, but can be bored out easily with M3 screws. Step Example Mount your Raspberry Pi with 6mm M3 screws onto the tray. Slide the tray into the side bay on the left side. Use M3 x 8mm screws to fasten the tray in place. 5. MCU Tray You will need: 4x M3 x 6mm screws 2x M4 x 8mm screws Your MCU (e.g., BIGTREETECH Octopus) The printed tray for your MCU Note The MCU tray has two M4 screw holes on the sides. These screw holes face forward when inserted in the case. When attaching your MCU to the tray, align your SD card connector toward the front and power connectors toward the back. Step Example Attach your MCU with the four (4) M3 x 6mm screws to the tray. Slide the tray from the back of the assembled case to the front. Stop when the screw holes in the tray align with the ones in the main body. Tighten the tray in place with two (2) M4 x 8mm screws. Connect your PSU and MCU. Be careful of polarity. 6. Front Panel You will need: 2x M3 x 8mm screws Your printed front panel Any accessories that mount to it and fasteners for them Step Example If you have any add-ons for your front panel (such as a MicroSD extension) install these first. Insert the front panel and attach with two (2) M3 screws. 7. Rear Panel You will need: 8x M4 x 8mm screws Your printed rear panel Any connectors or other accessories for the rear panel Step Example If you are using the rear panel to mount connectors, it is strongly advised that you insert the connectors to the panel first, before installing the panel or connecting any wires to the board. Line up the rear panel with the cutout on the assembled case. Check where the screw holes line up. If any are clearly unaligned, leave those for last. Starting with a screw hole near the top, partially thread an M4 screw in. Once you can feel the screw threads grab the main body, insert two full turns and stop. Partially thread another screw the same way on the other side. Continue to insert screws into the remaining holes, alternating the left and right sides. If any of the holes are still unaligned, you can try to insert a screw at an angle and thread. The screw may work itself straight; if not, leave the hole empty. Finish tightening all of the screws. Wire the front power switch, IEC power connector, and PSU. As always, be careful of polarity. 8. Display Screen You will need: 4x M3 x 6mm screws 4x M4 x 8mm screws Your printed display mount Your display Note Some display mounts have more than one piece and require additional screws. The below is an example with a stock Creality 12864 display. Step Example Remove the knob on the display screen. It should pull off. Slide the screen into place on the mount and fasten with four (4) M3 x 6mm screws. Re-attach the knob to the display screen. Again, it should slide into place with light force. If your display mount has multiple pieces, attach those now (usually only applies to displays with side-mount SD card readers). Attach the display connectors and slide the cables in before the display. Attach the display panel with two (2) M4 x 8mm screws on opposings sides. Avoid overtightening. The angle of the display may require inserting the remaining two (2) screws at an angle. You may also need to back out the first screws slightly and angle them as well. This is an artifact of the display angle. 9. Lid Like the rear panel, the lid is intended for customization. The below is an example for a simple lid with a handle. Step Example Assemble any parts that attach to the lid first. All of the lids attach with between four (4) and eight (8) M3 x 8mm screws, although any length up to 16mm will work. Note Because the screws are threaded directly into plastic, removing and reattaching the lid will eventually wear out the holes in the main body. I recommend starting with shorter screws and gradually switching to longer ones over time to get \"fresh\" plastic.","title":"Assembly Guide"},{"location":"assembly/#1-base","text":"You will need: 4x M4 x 16mm screws (20mm will work) 1x SPST toggle switch The printed front and rear base Step Example The two pieces of the base both have two (2) holes on each side.

You will need to print the following: 1x Base - Front 1x Base - Rear 1x Main Body - Front 1x Main Body - Front crossbar Rear Main Body The rear main body is part of the Core parts, but comes in two versions. The default has two 40mm fan cutouts with optional TPU gaskets. Alternatively, there is a rear main body that lacks fan cutouts. Only use the rear body without fans if you are using a rear panel that mounts a 60mm or larger fan. You will need to print one of the following two lists: Default : 1x Main Body - Rear 2x 40mm fan cages (Optional) 2x 40mm TPU gaskets Without Fans 1x Main Body - Rear No Fans Customizable Parts The list below link to repository folders. You will need to choose the right .STL based on your configuration and preferences. Each folder has a readme.md with help choosing the right file and any attribution. Trays: 1x MCU 1x CPU (Optional) 2x Lower bay trays for buck converters, SSRs, etc. Panels: 1x Display mount 1x Lid 1x Rear panel ( see below ) 1x Front panel Note Templates in STEP format are provided for most of the case to allow customization as needed. Where possible, a Fusion archive file is also provided. Rear Panel Configuration This is a very user-specific panel and the most customizable part of the case. The Rear Panel has multiple subfolders. Most users will want to use a Generic panel. These have large holes for passing wires through and come in a number of common variations. The Molex folder contains files for preconfigured rear panels that mount Molex Micro Fit 3 connectors. Wiring diagrams for each panel are included. The Template folder contains a Fusion template with profiles for panel mounted connectors and fans. Users who want to create their own panel should start here. A more detailed guide to choosing a rear panel can be found in the Rear Panel README file.

Setting Value Note Layer Height 0.2-0.24mm I would not recommend going finer; I have not tried 0.28 or coarser. Perimeters (Walls) 3 Walls should be at least 1.2mm thick or screws will not grab well. Infill 20-25% Cubic is generally a good choice. Material PLA or PLA+ PETG is somewhat brittle and will take longer to print. Nozzle Diameter 0.4mm 0.6mm should also work.
