# Generic Panels

Each subfolder contains panels have cutouts to run wires through instead of panel mounts. Most users will want to use one of these.

There are still two configuration options:

## USB Port

- No USB panel mount
- USB A panel mount (SKR and most other boards)
- USB C panel mount (BTT Octopus and many newer boards)

Micro-USB to USB A panel mount connectors are available. Ex: Creality and many 8-bit boards use these.

## 60mm Fan Cutout

Each panel has a version with this cutout if you want to use a 60mm fan instead of (or in addition to) the default dual 40mm fans.

These panels are all made from the same template. The source Fusion file also includes an 80mm fan profile if you'd like to go larger.
